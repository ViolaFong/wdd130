    <p>Greetings Everyone. It's fun to see what different backgrounds we all have, and yet there are many things in common.</p>
    <p>I'm a transplant to Northern alifornia from Ontario Canada, the child of German immigrants. My husband, a retired farmer, is a California native. Hiking, reading, family history, family, and serving to help hasten the Lord's work - these are among my passions. One of my callings involves JustServe, and as part of that, we've organized a 3rd Thursday Humanitarian Day which we hold monthly (come anytime between 1-9 pm and work on any one of about 10 projects that bless those in need). That, along with caring for our 96 years old aunt who lives with us, keeps me mostly out of trouble.</p>
    <p>My course of study is computer programing and web design. I love the logic involved, but often find that little details cause big hitches. That's why my computer and I are on speaking terms but not really kindred spirits. Still, I love learning, and this is stretching my old brain in ways I enjoy most of the time. While I have no further career plans, I can think of a number of ways this education may be useful in the future. We'll see where the road leads.</p>
