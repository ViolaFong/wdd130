      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>WEMM, the Woodland Ecumenical and Multi-faith Ministries council, is an interfaith committee in Woodland. While we’ve been in existence well over a decade, we are still largely unknown in the community. Our goals are:
        1) To increase our visibility in Woodland. 
        2) Invite other churches and faith communities to join us,
        3) Invite the community to participate with us in service and celebration.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our audience is:
        1) The general citizenry of Woodland, CA, 
        2) Those inclined to faith, and those who are not,
        3) Leaders and members of faith communities in this area - both those who are already WEMM members and those who are not,
        4) Woodland community influencers.
    
        What do they want? 
        1) To know what WEMM is and what it stands for,
        2) To know what WEMM is doing or has done in the community and the kinds of things we help with,
        3) To know how they can join our events and contribute to our initiatives,
        4) To know how their faith community can join our committee.
    
        How will our audience access the site? Via desktop, labtop, and/or mobile devices.</p>

      <h3>Interfaith Events</h3>
      <p class="Interfaith Events">
        WEMM believes that rubbing shoulders with others in the community who may believe differently than we do helps all of us develop more tolerance, understanding, and appreciation for each other. Many of our activities are designed for that purpose. There is so much good being done by so many, no matter what their background or belief may be. We want to celebrate the good in all of us.
      </p>
      <p class="Peace Picnic">
        Peace Picnic – Our last Peace Picnic was held on 
https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2022/09/16/community-invited-to-annual-interfaith-peace-picnic/
"We can only make it together - we can only be safe together.  We can be prosperous only together. We can survive only together. We can be human only together." These are the words of the late South African Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu, referring to the struggle against apartheid. But the words could just as easily be spoken of here and now, of Woodland in 2022. 
When the Muslim community in Woodland and throughout the United States felt unsafe in the aftermath of 9/11, rather than stay stuck in that feeling of victimhood, they realized that they would only be able to feel safe and survive if they reached out to others in order to build a sense of togetherness. From that effort, the annual Interfaith Community Peace Picnic was born. 
The Peace Picnic, to be held on Saturday, September 24th this year, 11 am to 3:30 pm at Ferns Park (750 West Southwood Drive), is designed to put into action the American Muslim Voice Foundation’s motto “From fear to friendship”. All community members – individuals, families, groups, are invited to join in this event as we rub shoulders with our neighbors and see past our differences to our common humanity. 
The event is free. And, of course, there will be food! The Woodland Mosque & Islamic Center sponsors the lunch of restaurant-catered Pakistani Food. The American Lutheran Church provides beverages, and all are invited (but not required) to bring a salad or dessert to add to the culinary experience. 
The Peace Picnic is a collaborative effort of the American Muslim Voice, the Woodland Ecumenical and Multi-faith Ministries (WEMM), and the Woodland Mosque & Islamic Center. All three organizations seek to promote interfaith harmony and community harmony.
There will be games for the children, and music to enjoy besides the great food. However, the main goal is to spend time in the same space, finding out that no matter what obvious or subtle differences we may have, we also have much in common. No matter what makes you unique or the same, we hope you will join with us and we’ll all be a little more “human only together”.
